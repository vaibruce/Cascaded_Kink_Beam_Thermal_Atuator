# Cascaded_Kink_Beam_Thermal_Atuator
This paper describes the design, simulation and fabrication of a Cascaded Kink Beam MEMS Thermal actuator. Thermal actuators based on Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) are highly advantageous because of their ability to deliver the actuation with great displacement and force. The basic principle of working isohmic heating effect resulting in thermal expansion of the beams, thereby providing displacement in the actuators. The Cascaded kink Beam Thermal Actuator geometrically amplifies the thermal expansion of the beams. The proposed is a cascaded kink beam actuator including a bent beam structure to provide increased displacement. The design provides static displacement greater than 35um for an applied potential of 6 volts, requiring an area of 2mm x 2mm square meter. This performance is achieved at lower drive voltages necessary for the actuation, without effecting the elastic nature of the structure, also the variation in temperature is not exceeding the temperature point with stress lesser than the maximum limit of silicon material.
